# vue-adaptive-utils

> Deliver empathetic experiences to your users by adapting to their capabilities

Inspired by [react-adaptive-hooks](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/react-adaptive-hooks), and a continuation of my work in [vue-use-web](https://github.com/logaretm/vue-use-web).

This is a collection of Vue 3.0 composition API functions and utilties to allow your apps to adapt your user's:

- Network conditions.
- Battery Status.
- CPU Cores.
- Device Memory.

## Install

```sh
yarn add vue-adaptive-utils

# or

npm i vue-adaptive-utils --save
```

## Usage

Import the composition function(s) that you will use:

```js
import { useNetworkStatus } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';
import { useBattery } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';
import { useHardwareConcurrency } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';
import { useMemoryStatus } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';
```

Each of the composition functions return an `unsupported` value to indicate if the API is supported or not.

> âš  All the values exposed are **read only** and cannot be mutated.

### Network Status

This is a **compounded API**, meaning it collects various information from multiple APIs, them being the `Connection API` and `online/offline` events.

**Partial Compatibility**: The `unsupported` flag here refers to the availability of the `Connection API`, the `isOnline` and `offlineAt` properties should be available in all browsers.

```js
import { useNetworkStatus } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';

const {
  isOnline,
  saveData,
  offlineAt,
  downlink,
  downlinkMax,
  effectiveConnectionType,
  networkType,
  unsupported
} = useNetworkStatus();
```

### Battery Status

This is an experimental API and is only available on Chrome at the moment.

```js
import { useBattery } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';

const { charging, chargingTime, dischargingTime, level, unsupported } = useBattery();
```

### Hardware Concurrency (CPU Cores)

```js
import { useHardwareConcurrency } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';

const { concurrency, unsupported } = useHardwareConcurrency();
```

### Memory Status

This is a **compounded API**, meaning it collects various information from multiple APIs, mainly the `navigator.deviceMemory` and `navigator.performance`.

```js
import { useHardwareConcurrency } from 'vue-adaptive-utils';

const { deviceMemory, totalJSHeapSize, usedJSHeapSize, jsHeapSizeLimit, unsupported } = useMemoryStatus();
```
